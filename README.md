# Haskell-Project-1

Task 1:
Program prints "Hello,the world is beautiful" 

Task 2:
Function that accepts a list (1st) of integers as the parameter, and filters out a sub-list (of 1st) which contains all 3's multiples in 1st (if any). As an example, if 1st is [24,12,4,15,25,32], then the output is [24,12,15].

Task 3:
Write a function that accepts a list (1st) of integers as the parameter, and returns x where x is the number of negative integers in the list 1st.

Task 4:
Program accepts an integer as the parameter, and if the integer is positive then it breaks it into its digits and the output is a list of digits. On the other hand, if the input is not a positive integer, the function returns and empty list.
